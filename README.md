In the context of chatbots, RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Itâ€™s an advanced AI architecture that combines two main components:
	1.	Retrieval: The model first retrieves relevant information from a large external knowledge base or documents to get accurate and context-specific data.
	2.	Generation: It then uses a generative model (like GPT) to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response using the retrieved information.
