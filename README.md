# College Chatbot using RAG

## Overview
This project aims to build an intelligent chatbot for colleges using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The chatbot will assist students, faculty, and visitors by providing accurate and quick answers to queries related to admissions, courses, faculty, exams, placements, and campus facilities.

## Problem Statement
Currently, accessing college-related information is inefficient due to fragmented resources and communication bottlenecks. Our chatbot will address this issue by leveraging **transformer-based models** to provide precise and relevant answers.

## Key Components
To build this chatbot, we need to work on several models step by step:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Collect and clean college-related documents (FAQs, syllabi, notices, etc.).
   - Chunk text into smaller segments for better retrieval.
   - Convert text into **vector embeddings** using models like **BERT** or **SBERT**.

### 2. **Embedding Model**
   - Use **BERT** or **SBERT** to generate embeddings from processed documents.
   - Store these embeddings in a **vector database** (FAISS or ChromaDB) for efficient retrieval.

### 3. **Retrieval Model**
   - When a user inputs a query, search for the most relevant documents using the **vector database**.
   - Retrieve top-ranked results and send them to the language model for response generation.

### 4. **Generation Model**
   - Use a **Transformer-based language model** (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2, or T5) to generate a natural language response based on retrieved information.
   - Fine-tune the model, if necessary, to better align with college-specific terminology and queries.

### 5. **API Development**
   - Develop a **Flask** or **FastAPI** backend to connect all components.
   - Create API endpoints for chatbot queries and responses.

### 6. **Frontend Integration**
   - Build a **React** or **Vue.js** UI for the chatbot.
   - Ensure user-friendly design and mobile responsiveness.

### 7. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Test the chatbot using real student and faculty queries.
   - Deploy the chatbot on **cloud services** (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
   - Optimize performance and improve response accuracy.
