    "text": "Tessellator is KMIT's Learning Management System. It is a customized version of Moodle, an open-source learning management system provided by Google. We at KMIT have customized it as per our needs and have been using it on multiple networks. It provides an option of two different modules. After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz, which is a collection of multiple-choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write a code program (e.g., Java, C) pertaining to the class held. There are usually three programs given to the students as part of the test. If the student is a slow learner, he or she might be able to work on a single program, while the fast learners may go to the third program. Google's platform, Moodle by itself, doesn't have the code compilation technique, but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for Java, C, and a few other programming languages."
